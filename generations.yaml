    description: "The MG4 Electric (known as the MG Mulan in China) represents MG's first purpose-built electric vehicle based on parent company SAIC's new Modular Scalable Platform (MSP), designed specifically for electric vehicles. This compact hatchback features distinctive, angular styling with sharp character lines, a striking two-tone roof, and a full-width LED light bar at the rear. With a length of approximately 4.3 meters and low-slung proportions, the MG4 offers a sportier stance than typical MG models. The unique battery architecture utilizes an extremely thin (just 110mm) horizontally-mounted battery pack that enables both a low center of gravity and generous interior space. Initially offered with two battery options: a 51kWh version providing approximately 217-218 miles of range (WLTP) and a 64kWh version offering up to 281 miles. The electric motor is mounted at the rear, making the MG4 MG's first rear-wheel drive passenger car in decades, producing either 168 horsepower in the standard version or 201 horsepower in the long-range variant. Later additions to the lineup included the high-performance XPower variant with dual motors, all-wheel drive, and 429 horsepower, capable of 0-62 mph in 3.8 seconds. The interior features a minimalist, modern design with a floating 10.25-inch infotainment screen, 7-inch digital instrument cluster, and a clean dashboard layout. Advanced technology includes MG Pilot driver assistance systems with adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, and traffic jam assist. Charging capabilities support up to 135kW DC fast charging, enabling a 10-80% charge in approximately 35 minutes for the long-range version. The MG4 Electric represents MG's most technologically advanced vehicle to date and a significant step in the brand's evolution, offering competitive range, performance, and features at a value price point compared to established electric competitors."
